# Applied Data Science with Python Specialization

This repository contains the coding assignment for Applied Data Science with Python Specialization (Coursera). This code is not otpimized and has as a sole purpose to let people who can't submit their code to check if their results are correct. For the ones who can submit their code to get it verified, don't copy paste this code as it is way too interesting to get to think about the problems in the assignments and It is by far the best way to get you going one day on your own in this field ( + It's not legal to copy paste code ).
